/**
 * Simulates fetching data from web/APIs and processing with an LLM.
 * In a real application, this function would:
 * 1. Use a search API (Google PSE, Bing, SerpAPI) or web scraping (Puppeteer, Cheerio)
 * to find relevant web pages based on the query.
 * 2. Extract content from these pages.
 * 3. Send the query and extracted content to an LLM API (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude).
 * 4. Parse the LLM's response to get the summarized answer, potential image ideas, and source URLs.
 * 5. Return the structured data.
 *
 * This simulation provides hardcoded responses for specific queries for demonstration.
